# CsProject3

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jweezy24/CsProject3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jweezy24/CsProject3)

Online Pong. Users can play matches of pong on a local network.

## Getting Started

Make sure to look at installing before starting the program. 

To run the local client, run the command `python3 ./pong/pong.py`. This will run the game. The game will load into a searching screen. In this screen UDP packets are broadcasted over the user's local internet looking for the match making server. To launch the server, run from the parent directory, `python3 ./server/serverMain.py`. You will need another player on that network to play with you.  


## Functionality

  ### Pong

  * Classic pong game-play

  * Username functionality

  * Able to remember win rate

  * Instant local peer to peer match making

  * Very little lag

  * Rare desyncing

  ### Server

  * Local data storage using CSV files to maintain a local database

  * Json packet communication

  * UDP socket management

  * Multicast support for matching players

  * Basic lobby management



## Installing

Before running the code, you need to install the requirements. To do this run the command.

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then you should be all set to go.

## Running the tests

All tests will be ran in travis. Although, running the tests manually is also an option. From the parent directory run these commands to see all the tests.

### Player Tests
`python3 ./tests/player_tests.py`

### Ball Tests
`python3 ./tests/ball_tests.py`

### Server Tests
`python3 ./tests/server_tests.py`
